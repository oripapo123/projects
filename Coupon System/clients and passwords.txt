A bit about the project.
------------------------

We were asked to build a coupon managing system for different businesses, and also for the general public.
The system agrees to 3 different users, Clients (general public), Business Owners, and Administrators.
Each has its own properties and classifications to the system.

The system works with a remote Database, but for it to work on other's computers, the database is currently local.

My job was the system itself, from GUI to BL and DB. (The whole project had lots of documentation which my partner's
job)
